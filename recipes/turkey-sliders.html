    <p>These little turkey slider sandwiches, made with deli turkey, come together in minutes and are perfect for parties, lunches, dinner, and game day snacks. We particularly enjoy using black pepper turkey for these sliders.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slider buns</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>

        <li>8 thin slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon everything bagel seasoning, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p></li>

        <li><p>In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and pickle relish. Spread the dressing on the bottom halves of the buns, and place a pickle slice on top of each.</p></li>
        <li><p>Put a half slice of turkey on each, folding to fit. Top with Swiss cheese, again either folding or cutting to fit, and place remaining half  turkey slices on top of the cheese. Place the tops of the buns on the sandwiches.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place sliders on the prepared baking sheet. Stir together melted butter and Worcestershire, brush slider buns with butter, and sprinkle with everything seasoning. Cover with foil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese begins to melt, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake until buns are golden, about 3 minutes. Cool for about 3 minutes, and serve warm.</p></li>
